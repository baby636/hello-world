Our campaign is being built on pure Block Production and the journey therein. 

We do not plan on performing any other activities except specialising 100% in the mechanics of Block Production and everything that comes with that. This includes a community outreach program through meetups, supporting online users operating EOS accounts, wallets and tools, and of course the governance and constitutional responsibilities required of Block Producers. 

As a Block Producer the block rewards that we receive will be reinvested in the production infrastructure and a percentage will be donated to the <a href="https://eoseniversity.io" target="_blank">EOSUniversity.io</a> project which we are sponsoring.

In the main EOS UK block rewards will be invested in more equipment, more staff, more bandwidth, more RAM, more servers and ensuring we have everyting we need in order to be the most robust, secure, transparent and approachable Block Producer it is possible for us to become. 

Being a UK based organisation we intend to establish secondary physical nodes and API end points in Scotland and Wales Data Centre locations, in addition to our England node in Nottingham to provide fast access to the EOS network primarily for the UK community. 

At launch we have provisioned secondary instances at the Hetzner Data Centre in Germany because it is a company we have worked with extensively in the past and it was simpler for us to setup the failover there until we are able to thoroughly research our failover locations in the UK. A German failover location seemed like a good idea from the point of view of Geographical diversity, whilst still being local to the UK in terms of connectivity, and of course German Engineering is world renowned for quality which is relfected in our past experience working with Hetzner.
