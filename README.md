Our campaign is being built on pure Block Production and the journey therein. 

We do not plan on performing any other activities except specialising 100% on the mechanics of Block Production. 

When we are voted in as Block Producer the block rewards that we receive will be reinvested in the Production infrastructure.

It will be invested in more equipment, more staff, more bandwidth, more RAM, more servers. 

As EOS UK we intend to establish nodes in Wales and Scotland Data Centre locations. 

As well as more security audits and stress tests, and failover drills, there will be innovation in better and simpler ways to manage the nodes and everything that goes with creating the most robust Block Production node that it is possible to create.
